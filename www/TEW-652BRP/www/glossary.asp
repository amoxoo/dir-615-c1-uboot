   ensure delivery of a complete message&#151;TCP provides the function
   of ensuring delivery. </p>
 <p><span class="bluetextbold3">IP Address<A NAME="def_ip_address"></A><br>
   </span>The IP (Internet Protocol) address refers to the address of a
   computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server
   station must have a unique IP address. Clients are assigned either a
   permanent address or have one dynamically assigned to them via DHCP.

   Internet communications protocol. The TCP part ensures that data is
   completely sent and received at the other end. Another part of the
   TCP/IP protocol set is UDP, which is used to send data when accuracy
   and guaranteed packet delivery are not as important (for example, in
   realtime video and audio transmission). </P>
<P> The IP component of TCP/IP provides data routability, meaning that
  data packets contain the destination station and network addresses,
  enabling TCP/IP messages to be sent to multiple networks within the
  LAN or in the WAN.</P>

   there is no time for retransmitting the data). </P>
 <P><span class="bluetextbold3">Virtual Servers<A NAME="def_virtual_server"></A><br>
  </span>Virtual servers are client servers (such as Web servers) that share
   resources with other virtual servers (i.e., it is not a dedicated server). </P>
